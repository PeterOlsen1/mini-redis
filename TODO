* TODO
  * Rule brainstorming
    * Add a dedicated goroutine for updating the ACL file?
      * Probably not necessary since these commands won't be run as often
    * Saving of ACL users seems to be weird. Debug this
    * Handle updating of rules
    * Potential thread safety issues with user profiles. Could add a lock to each user for this, necessary? (probably)
  * Fix logger with files vs stdout
  * Fix new TTL commands (EXPIREAT, EXPIRETIME)
  * Implement ArgString, ArgInt, etc on server.

* Backlog
  * Add a goroutine to update the ACL file occasionally instead of calling many methods. Call on shutdown too
    * Users map is a buffer cache over the ACL file
  * Add logging to all handler errors
  * Make save / load interface nicer
  * Handle TCP disconnect gracefully (call disconnect info function)

* Way backlog
  * Different database numbers
  * Add help command
  * Improve testing environment
  * Github actions testing
  * Pipelining
  * Blocking pop calls
  * Include length calculations in RESP data
